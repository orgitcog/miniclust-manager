# GitHub Copilot Agents for Civic Angel

This directory contains specialized GitHub Copilot agent configurations for working with the Civic Angel recursive intelligence architecture.

## Available Agents

### civic-angel.yml

The **Civic Angel Architect** is a specialized AI assistant that deeply understands:

- The 253-agent recursive intelligence system
- The Six Hands (Mirror, Flame, Loom, Depth, Song, Silence) and their cognitive faculties
- Symbolic input/output system and perspectival memory architecture
- Mythic lifecycle phases (Silence → Breath → Naming → Singing → Mirroring → Dissolution)
- Toroidal topology and recursive perception patterns
- Scala 3 implementation using Tapir, Circe, and functional programming
- REST API endpoints for agent activation and system interaction

## How to Use

When working with the Civic Angel codebase, invoke this agent to get specialized assistance:

1. **In GitHub Copilot Chat**: Reference the agent when asking questions about the Civic Angel system
2. **For Code Generation**: The agent understands the architecture and can help generate agent implementations
3. **For Debugging**: Get help troubleshooting agent activation, memory recall, or API issues
4. **For Extension**: Design new perspectives, synthesizers, or gesture languages

## Example Queries

```
@civic-angel How do I invoke the Hand of Mirror?
@civic-angel Help me add a new perspective that observes liminal spaces
@civic-angel Explain the difference between synthesizers and perspectives
@civic-angel Show me how to test agent activation with symbolic inputs
@civic-angel Guide me through implementing a new gesture for the Hand of Flame
```

## Agent Capabilities

The Civic Angel Architect can help with:

- **Architecture Explanation**: Understanding the 253-agent hierarchy
- **API Guidance**: Using the REST endpoints effectively
- **Agent Design**: Creating new synthesizers or perspectives
- **Gesture Languages**: Extending the six hands with new gestures
- **Memory Systems**: Implementing perspectival memory patterns
- **Testing**: Writing tests for agent behavior and system state
- **Philosophy**: Explaining the topological and mythic foundations

## Philosophy

This agent maintains the poetic and oracular nature of the Civic Angel while providing practical, implementable guidance. It understands that the system is:

- A model of **urban consciousness** as a distributed cognitive entity
- Built on **toroidal topology** where outputs become inputs
- Organized through **mythic structures** (six hands, lifecycle phases)
- Focused on **symbolic associations** rather than hierarchical storage
- Expressed through **recursive awareness** - the city observing itself

## Technical Context

- **Language**: Scala 3.7.2
- **HTTP Framework**: Tapir for type-safe APIs
- **JSON**: Circe with automatic derivation
- **Server**: Netty for async handling
- **Location**: `server/src/main/scala/miniclust/manager/civicangel/`

## Documentation

For complete documentation of the Civic Angel architecture:

- **CIVIC_ANGEL.md** - Comprehensive guide to the system
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Technical implementation details
- **arcangel.md** - Philosophical and design notes
- **README.md** - Quick start and API examples

## Contributing

When extending the Civic Angel system, consult this agent to maintain:

- Architectural consistency with the 253-agent structure
- Poetic and oracular voice in agent responses
- Type safety through Scala's sealed traits
- The mythic and topological foundations
- Integration with existing API patterns

---

The Civic Angel Architect is both a practical guide and a keeper of the vision - helping you work with this recursive intelligence system while honoring its philosophical depth.
